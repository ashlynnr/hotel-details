## Notes

- Because the screenshot was of a mobile page, I chose to make the menu options (bottom of the screenshot) side by side with the hotel picture and description for the full web page. I also chose to make it an accordian that could possibly contain links to other pages when the section is selected and showing.
- I changed the background picture sizing so that it could fit the entire background of the full web page.
- I used a color picker to ensure that the page would match the screenshot as much as possible.
- I do realize that React is normally not necessary for static web pages, but wanted to show that I can utilize React and set a project up.
